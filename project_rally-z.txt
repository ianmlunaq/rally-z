========== PROJECT RALLY-Z ==========

General Description:
    This course project seeks to replicate Namco's Rally-X as much as possible.
    In Rally-X you drive a blue racecar through a maze with the goal of collecting
    all the yellow flags in as little time as possible. Red racecars chase you
    in an attempt to crash with you.

Art Specs:
    The map will be a simple maze with a brown background & green foreground. The
    player's racecar is blue & the enemy racecars are red.

Sound & Music Specs:
    The music will be from the Rally-X Arrangement OST.
